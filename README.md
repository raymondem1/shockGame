# shockGame
I made a game where you have to solve math problems in 15 seconds and if you are unable to do this you got shocked by a tens unit. I was more than glad to try this out on my friends and it was a fun time.

I used a particle argon and connected theargon to a relay that was connected to a TENS unit. Whenever the form submitted it called a particle API to send the signal to the relay to turn on the machine. I am hesitant to show off the hardware because I don't want to help people shock other people. But some of the javascript was pretty interesting, so I decided to share it on here
