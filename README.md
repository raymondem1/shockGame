# shockGame
I made a game where you have to solve math problems in 15 seconds and if you are unable to do this you got shocked by a tens unit. I was more than glad to try this out on my friends and it was a fun time.

Also it should be noted that the only thing that would be necessary to change in this repo for the project to work would be the url where the form submits. I did not want to make my device information public.

I used a particle argon and connected theargon to a relay that was connected to a TENS unit. Whenever the form submitted it called a particle API to send the signal to the relay to turn on the machine. I am hesitant to show off the hardware because I don't want to help people shock other people. But some of the javascript was pretty interesting, so I decided to share it on here
